PROJECT TITLE:Monty Hall Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: In this simulation you will play the Monty Hall game many times to decide
 * whether the contestant has a better chance of winning the car if they stick
 * with their original door or switch to the alternative door.
 * A contestant is shown three doors, labelled 1, 2 and 3. Two of the doors have
 * a goat behind them and the other has a car. The contestant choses a door
 * hoping to pick the car, but this door is not opened yet.
 * 
 * Then the game show host secretly examines what is behind the other doors and
 * selects one that has a goat (if both doors have goats, he picks one of them
 * randomly).
 * This door is eliminated from the game, leaving the door the contestant
 * selected and another door, which we will refer to as the alternative door.
 * 
 * The contestant is then asked whether they want to stick with their original
 * door, or to switch to the alternative door.
